Simple JavaScript code that can be built with React Native for controlling eightSleep   

src/EightSleep.js controls the levels. See https://github.com/lukas-clarke/pyEight for the Python this was based on and some instructions for obtaining keys.

App.jsx is a simple mobile app that lets you cool in short cycles. You can start with an initial cooling time, then define how often you get a short cooling refresh. This is so you don't have to have the pod running constantly.
